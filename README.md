## About bignum branch

Once I discovered the BigInteger datatype, having already made a Rational (fraction) class, I looked into arbitrary-precision floating point. I learned one way to do this is to use two arbitrary-precesion numbers (BigInteger) in a fraction.

Great! I think, I can just use the BigInteger Fractation to represent everything! I'll just write the math functions to use BigInteger Fractions!

### Lesson 1: "Just" is an obscene four-letter word

This strategy was going okay until I got into things like logrithims and roots. Preformance issues are causing too many problems. I realized I was writting my own arbitrary-precision library, That's not what I had intended when I started this project.

### Lesson 2: Remember your project scope

I kept on for a little bit, because I put so much effort into the branch.

### Lesson 4: Beware the sunk-cost fallacy

So I've decided to stop working on this branch, but since I did put a lot of effort into some of these functions, I'm leaving the branch here for reference. I haven't decided on the specific license for the entire project as of this writting but treat it will be some sort of open source (maybe give me a shout out if you use it.)
